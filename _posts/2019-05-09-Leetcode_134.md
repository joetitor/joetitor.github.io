## 题目描述

There are *N* gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station *i* is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station *i* to its next station (*i*+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

- If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
- Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
- Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```

### Solution
题意要求判断能否用加油站的油量绕行一周。显然当加油站能能供的油量小于需要消耗的油量时无法完成绕行；而当总油量不小于总消耗时，一定可以完成绕行。
若能完成绕行，意味着汽车能够到达每个加油站，则油箱中油的余量总是非负的，因此当余量为负时则意味着起始位置不正确，需要寻找新的起始点。
其实问题可以转变成对寻找数组surplus的起始点，从起始点开始对其中的元素依次求和，使得和非负；而当surplus总和非负时，起始点一定存在


```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):    return -1
        
        # surplus 为当前加油站的油量减去消耗后的剩余
        surplus = list(map(lambda x, y: x-y, gas, cost))
        # remain: 油箱的油量， start: 起始位置
        remain, start = 0, -1
        for idx, sp in enumerate(surplus):
            remain += sp
            if remain < 0:
                remain, start = 0, -1
            elif start == -1:
                start = idx
                
        return start
            
```
