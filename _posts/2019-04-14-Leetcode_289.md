## 题目描述

According to the [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a *board* with *m* by *n* cells, each cell has an initial state *live* (1) or *dead* (0). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.


**Example:**

```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```





### 原地算法
原地算法仅利用少量的存储空间，需要对状态编码。将原本的两个状态扩充成四个状态：
0 --- 死， 1 --- 活， 2 --- 将活， 3 --- 将死
```python
class Solution:
    def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        
        # 增加两个中间状态，2---将活，3---将死
        # 细胞状态的更新不是一次完成的，而是首先经过中间态
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                board[i][j] = self.hiddenState(board, (i, j))
                
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                board[i][j] = self.finalState(board[i][j])
        
        
    def finalState(self, state):
        return 1 if state == 1 or state == 2 else 0
        
        
    def hiddenState(self, board, loc):
        x0, y0 = loc
        live_neighbors = 0
        next_state = board[x0][y0]
        
        moves = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
        
        for move in moves:
            x, y = map(sum, zip(loc, move))
            if 0 <= x < len(board) and 0 <= y < len(board[0]):
                live_neighbors += (board[x][y] % 2)
        
        if board[x0][y0] == 1:
            if live_neighbors  < 2:
                next_state = 3
            elif live_neighbors <=3:
                next_state = 1
            else:
                next_state = 3
        elif live_neighbors == 3:
                next_state = 2
                
        return next_state
```
