## 题目描述

There are _n_ bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the i-th round, you toggle every i bulb. For the _n_-th round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds



**Example: **

```
Input: 3
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.
```



### Solution 1

对第k个灯泡来说，它的每一个因数都会使其切换一次；当最终这个灯泡是亮的，则切换了奇数次，说明k有奇数个因数。

方法一是直接计算n以内的每个值的因数个数，并统计其为奇数的个数。算法时间复杂度高, 为$O(n^2)$ 。

``` python
class Solution:
    def bulbSwitch(self, n: int) -> int:
        bulbs = []
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            bulbs.append(self.getDivisor(i))
        return sum([1 for count in bulbs if count % 2])
    
    def getDivisor(self, num):
        if num == 1:    
            return 1
        counts = 2
        for i in range(2, num//2+1):
            if not num % i:
                counts += 1               
        return counts
```

### Solution 2 

方法二：只有完全平方数的因数个数才是奇数，因此只需要统计n以内的完全平方数的个数，时间复杂度$O(1)$。

```python
class Solution:
    def bulbSwitch(self, n: int) -> int:
        return int(n**0.5)
```
